# Problem Statement

1. Identify relationships and patterns between flight characteristics and delays/cancellations to optimize flight performance and enhance operational efficiency.

2. Understand persistent issues with airline operations to improve passenger experience.

## Objective
Determine whether there are specific times during the day where flights between Washington, DC, and Newark, NJ, experience significant variations in velocity. 

- Predict flight delays using aircraft type and other characteristics to examine how aircraft type may affect delays.​

- Investigate relationships between flight velocities and arrival delays for selected origin-destination pairs.​

- Explore correlations between cancellations/delays and flight origins to identify problem airports.​

- Analyze whether particular aircrafts were consistently delayed and/or delayed for longer periods

## Prediction and Model Training
A machine learning model was trained using velocity as the target variable, with the aim of predicting when flight velocities would exceed 200 knots.

## Analysis and Findings
The analysis revealed that specific times during the day, particularly early morning and late-night flights, tend to experience lower average velocities, indicating potential inefficiencies or increased congestion during these hours.
