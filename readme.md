# Problem Statement

## Objective
Determine whether there are specific times during the day where flights between Washington, DC, and Newark, NJ, experience significant variations in velocity. The objective is to determine whether specific times during the day lead to significant variations in flight velocity.

## Prediction and Model Training
A machine learning model was trained using velocity as the target variable, with the aim of predicting when flight velocities would exceed 200 knots.

## Analysis and Findings
The analysis revealed that specific times during the day, particularly early morning and late-night flights, tend to experience lower average velocities, indicating potential inefficiencies or increased congestion during these hours.
